1. In Network Tab of Developer Tools (Browser)

To view the HTTP header details when accessing the Hello World REST endpoint:

- Open Chrome Developer Tools (Press F12 or right-click > Inspect).
- Go to the Network tab.
- Make a request to the endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:8080/hello).
- Click on the request name (e.g., hello).
- In the right panel, under the Headers tab:
  - General: Shows the request URL, method (GET), status code (200 OK).
  - Response Headers: Shows metadata returned from the server.
  - Request Headers: Shows metadata sent by the browser.

Example Response Headers:
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8

Date: Wed, 10 Jul 2025 08:00:00 GMT

2. In Postman - Headers Tab

To view HTTP headers using Postman:

- Open Postman and send a GET request to http://localhost:8080/hello.
- After receiving the response, click on the Headers tab in the response panel.
- You will see key HTTP response headers such as:

Example:
content-type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
content-length: 12
date: Wed, 10 Jul 2025 08:00:00 GMT

These headers confirm that the server returned a plain text response (Hello World), and provide metadata about the response format, size, and timestamp.
